		<h2>Where we fit</h2>
		<p>
			Buffalo, once an epicenter of culture and status in America has since fallen out of the lime-light.  However, over the recent years a large initiative has come together to help bring Buffalo back to what it once was.  Technology and Tech Start-Ups have been a big part of this initiative and Buffalo Open Device Lab is here to provide more resources to local developers in an effort to educate individuals about technology and provide the resources necessary for local developers to hone their products and skills through testing.
